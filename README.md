# Guilherme Rossato's Blog

A project to create a website oriented with ajax that simulates a blog by loading repositories, commits and releases from github as posts.

[Try it out!](https://guilhermerossato.github.io)

It works by using Github's API to load the public stuff (commits/releases), then these are sorted and created according to a few rules.
