So a while ago I developed a declarative php module and it's great.

However there is different from React and JSX in the sense that HTML is not usually allowed to be put as it's source code, that is, while react elements can be written as:

<pre><code class="jsx">
	class Welcome extends React.Component {
		render() {
			return (
				<div class="welcome">
					<h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
					<p>I hope you feel well</p>
				</div>
			);
		}
	}
</code></pre>

My module has it's source like this:

<pre><code class="php">
	class App extends Element {
		public function __construct($props) {
			parent::__construct(
				"div",
				["class" => "welcome"],
				new Element(
					"h1",
					null,
					"Hello, ".$props["name"]
				),
				new Element(
					"p",
					null,
					"I hope you feel well"
				)
			)
		}
	}
</code></pre>

As much as this allows for composition and configurability, we as developers are always hoping to write code faster, while maintaining quality.

One of the greatest part of react is that it's easy to write JSX because most of the web is already in HTML.

That means that sometimes we get HTML and must "parse" it into the module, which could be very time-consuming.

Thanksfully, there's a way to solve all of this! I present you, the declarative php translator!

Just paste some html at the left and get a resuling php content, plain and simple.

<div class="declarative-php-translator">
	<div class="input-textarea">
		<textarea name="input"></textarea>
	</div>
	<div class="output-textarea">
		<textarea name="output" readonly="readonly"></textarea>
	</div>
</div>
