title: Created my portofolio website
---

I have created my very own portofolio website, not my first, but I'm very happy with the results.

My path to developing this started by the layout, making a few minimal drawings to experiment with the proportions, then developed it with the help of chrome's dev tools syncronised with my local file system.

Then, when I was satisfied with the result, I ported the finished static website to jekyll, a static website generator that runs on Ruby. The idea of Jekyll is to pre-build everything on a website using Liquid Templating engine, preventing duplicated code of a static website and transforming an otherwise dynamic website in a fully static website.

To avoid downloading hundreds of potential project articles (and their images), my page is built with the first, latest article I have written, then as the user scrolls other posts are loaded assyncronously from a pre-built API interface, all done thought pure, vanilla javascript.

I also spent some time optimizing my website to pass some audits, just so I can brag about the score.
